##### This project uses Python and Opencv to detect and recognize faces. 
##### It was originally for live stream detection cloned from "https://github.com/ramonus/flask-video-stream"
##### It containts python3 script that serves Flask video webserver that allows to take photos or see real time video streaming of a connected camera/webcam controlled with opencv
##### I've added extra lines to program webcam to recognized my face  
###### what've done is briefly explained if you look into camera.py you can see how it can recognize the face 
#
- #### extra installation needed to recognize: 
 ````
$ pip3 install face_recognition 
 ````
